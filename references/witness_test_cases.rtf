Haunted by evil souls who were buried on unblessed ground. Records of devil worshiping and cannibalism take place under the fog, on the cemetery grounds at dusk. -  November 2005 update: Additional stories are a legend of an Indian who appears only as two red eyes peering out at you from the woods surrounding the cemetery. A local resident reports of a bat who flew in her driver's side window and out the passenger side window while driving the cemetery road as she passed the cemetery. Another report from a substitute teacher and a friend of hers who captured actual photographs of the paranormal from this site and was instructed by a physic to burn these photographs. The ghosts apparently do not wish to be photographed. The dates on the markers date hundreds of years back. There are two cemeteries in Weatherly, but this is the oldest, located on a dark, heavily wooded and curvy back road between the RD#2 road and Buck Mtn.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 'Bartenders, Trustees and Patrons have reported hearing and seeing things. A trustee was in the second floor office with the door open and was the only one in the building with all the doors locked. As he was doing paper work he heard a man\'92s voice behind him saying "help me". A bartender was done for the night with the doors locked and he being the only one in was just getting finished cleaning the bar. As he was done he threw the cleaning rag in the middle of the bar turned to hang the cleaning bottle and as he turned to switch off the TV he heard a noise behind him, as he turned to look, the bar rag was laying in the middle of the floor and the cleaning bottle was swinging back and forth. Also, apparently the ghost likes to play in the women\'92s bathroom by locking the doors and turning the water on. Reportedly, a man of age had died of a heart attack at this establishment.'\
